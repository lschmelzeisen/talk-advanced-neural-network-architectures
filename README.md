# Introduction to Advanced Neural Network Architectures for Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the slides of my talk [“Introduction to Advanced Neural Network Architectures for Natural Language Processing”](presentation.pdf).
The target audience are people new to Machine Learning and who have perhaps been exposed to the very basics fo neural networks before.
To follow, undergrad linear algebra knowledge should be enough.
The talk is designed to take roughly two hours.
It first reviews *deep learning basics*, thereafter presents proven architectures in natrual language processing (*recurrent* and *convolutional neural networks* and the *attention mechanism*), and finally introduces the current state-of-the-art approach of *pre-training* and *fine-tuning*, specifically the *OpenAI GPT* and *BERT* models.
